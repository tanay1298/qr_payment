# Database Design Documentation

## Database Table Constraints:

### Members
- `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
- `type`: Choices constrained to 'merchant' or 'customer'.
- `email`: Unique constraint to ensure each email is unique.
- `password`: No specific constraints other than field length.
- `created_at`: No specific constraints.

### Transactions
- `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
- `from_member_id`: Foreign key constraint referencing the `id` column of the `Members` table.
- `to_member_id`: Foreign key constraint referencing the `id` column of the `Members` table.
- `order_id`: Foreign key constraint referencing the `id` column of the `Orders` table.
- `amount`: No specific constraints other than field length.
- `status`: Choices constrained to 'Completed', 'Initiated', or 'Failed'.
- `timestamp`: No specific constraints.
- `payment_method`: No specific constraints other than field length.

### Orders
- `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
- `member_id`: Foreign key constraint referencing the `id` column of the `Members` table.
- `amount`: No specific constraints other than field length.
- `status`: Choices constrained to 'Created', 'Fulfilled', or 'Cancelled'.
- `timestamp`: No specific constraints.
- `description`: No specific constraints.

## Database Indexes:

Indexes can be added to columns frequently used in search queries or join operations to improve query performance. Consider adding indexes to the following columns:
- `email` column in the `Members` table for quick lookup of members by email.
- `from_member_id`, `to_member_id`, and `order_id` columns in the `Transactions` table for faster retrieval of transactions based on related members and orders.
- `member_id` column in the `Orders` table for efficient retrieval of orders associated with a specific member.

## Normalization:

The schema appears to be in third normal form (3NF), as each table represents a single entity, and there are no transitive dependencies. However, it's essential to ensure that data redundancy is minimized and that there are no repeating groups within the tables.

## Design Choices:

### Data Types:
- Using appropriate data types for each column helps optimize storage and ensure data integrity.
- For example, using `DecimalField` for financial amounts and `CharField` for textual data like email addresses.

### Foreign Keys:
- Establishing foreign key relationships between tables ensures referential integrity and helps maintain data consistency.
- For example, the `member_id` column in the `Orders` table references the `id` column in the `Members` table, ensuring that orders are associated with valid members.

### Enums for Choices:
- Using enums or choices for fields with a limited set of possible values, such as `type` and `status`, helps enforce data integrity and improves readability.

## Future Considerations:

### Scalability:
- As the application grows, consider strategies for horizontal and vertical scalability, such as database sharding, replication, and optimizing queries.

### Security:
- Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data, such as hashing passwords, enforcing HTTPS for communication, and implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Performance Optimization:
- Continuously monitor and optimize database performance by analyzing query execution plans, adding appropriate indexes, and denormalizing data where necessary.

### Auditing and Logging:
- Implement auditing and logging mechanisms to track changes to critical data, monitor system activities, and facilitate troubleshooting and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery:
- Establish regular backup procedures and disaster recovery plans to ensure data availability and integrity in case of hardware failures, natural disasters, or other unforeseen events.
